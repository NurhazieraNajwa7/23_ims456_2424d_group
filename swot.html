                    The fabric is incredibly soft and lightweight, making it perfect for all-day wear. The range of colors is fantastic, and it was hard to pick just one. The best part of my purchase was the delightful surprise of receiving a beautiful brooch as a free gift! I've already received numerous compliments when wearing this hijab. Thank you!

                The company's distribution network is primarily focused on the domestic market, and it faces challenges in expanding its presence globally.
                
                The hijab market might have various competitors offering similar products at different price points, putting pressure on the company's pricing strategy.
                
                If the company experiences rapid growth, it may face challenges in scaling up production to meet increasing demand.
                
                The company relies on specific suppliers for materials, which could be a vulnerability if supply chains are disrupted.
