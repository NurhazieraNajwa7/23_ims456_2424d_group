        <h2>Our History</h2>
        </center>
        <p>
            The Hijab was founded in 2023 by three friends, Nadia, Ain Wahida, and Nurhaziera Najwa. They were passionate
            about scarves and wanted to create a company that would offer high-quality scarves at an affordable
            price.
        </p>
        <p>
            The friends started the company with a small inventory of scarves that they had made themselves. They
            quickly realized that there was a demand for their scarves, and they soon began to sell them online and
            in local boutiques.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the years since its founding, The Hijab has grown to become a leading online retailer of scarves. The
            company now offers a wide variety of scarves, including silk scarves, wool scarves, and cotton scarves.
            The Hijab also offers a variety of colors and patterns to choose from.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Hijab is committed to providing its customers with the best possible shopping experience. The
            company offers free shipping on orders over RM100, and it also offers a satisfaction guarantee. If you
            are not happy with your scarf, you can return it for a full refund.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Hijab is proud to be a small business that is committed to providing its customers with
            high-quality products and excellent customer service. The company is excited to continue to grow and
            offer its customers even more great scarves in the years to come.
